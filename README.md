# Nonlinearity-model
The code for the work: 
Implementing feature binding through dendritic networks of a single neuron. 


The demo for the plot of Figure 1A in the paper. Other figures can be generated by changing model paramters.

### Model usage:
This code was written in and requires NEURON (tested in version 8.0) which is freely available from http://www.neuron.yale.edu.

This model was run under the unix/linux and windows 10 operating system.

### Proceed as follows:
- Download and expand this archive and compile the mod files located in the "mod" folder with nrnivmodl ("nrnivmodl mod" or "nrnivmodl ../mod" ).
- Run the demo for unix/linux: x84/64/special mosinit.hoc or for windows double click mosinit.hoc

*If you need more help running NEURON on your platform, please refer: https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide*

Once the code is running you can click  /Figure 1A:Run button.

Then one can generate a plot of the cell morphology as below
